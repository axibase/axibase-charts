# Calendar Syntax

## Overview

Calendar syntax implements convenient [keywords](#keywords) and [date arithmetic](#expressions) in cases where the calculated date depends on the current time.

For example, if the current time is `December 15, 2017 15:28:00`, the keyword `current_day` evaluates to `December 15, 2017 00:00:00` and the expression `current_hour - 1 * day` returns `December 14, 2017 15:00:00`.

Calendar [keywords](#keywords) are evaluated based on the [`timezone`](../widgets/shared/README.md#timezone) setting.

Date arithmetic such as adding or subtracting an interval is implemented using [expressions](#expressions).
